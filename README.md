# Open Program
During the minor Applied Data Science given by Fontys Hogescholen ICT we had the opportunity to explore parts of deep- and machine learning that we were interested in but were not covered during the core program. 

I chose to see how sound analysis and sound generation work. The projects and files for this can be found in this repository

## Sound classifier
The first step was to see how sound classification work. For this I used this article: [How to apply machine learning and deep learning methods to audio analysis](https://towardsdatascience.com/how-to-apply-machine-learning-and-deep-learning-methods-to-audio-analysis-615e286fcbbc) by Niko Laskaris.
