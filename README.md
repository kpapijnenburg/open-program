# Open Program
During the minor Applied Data Science given by Fontys Hogescholen ICT we had the opportunity to explore parts of deep- and machine learning that we were interested in but were not covered during the core program. 

I chose to see how sound analysis and sound generation work. The projects and files for this can be found in this repository

## Sound classifier
The first step was to see how sound classification work. For this I used this article: [How to apply machine learning and deep learning methods to audio analysis](https://towardsdatascience.com/how-to-apply-machine-learning-and-deep-learning-methods-to-audio-analysis-615e286fcbbc) by Niko Laskaris. 

## Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)
GANs can be used to generate output based on the given input. This is mostly used for generating images, but it could also be used to generate sound.

To better understand GANs I followed a [video tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8L11aMN5KY8) by Luis Serrano. The results of this tutorial can be found in the gans-tutorial folder.
